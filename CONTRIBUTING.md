# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project here are your options. 
I appreciate each and every bug report, feature request or merge request.

- contribute by creating a bug
- contribute by creating an issue
- contribute by opening a merge request

# Creating a bug

- What failed? (method-name, package)
- When did it fail (code snippet which shows the failing call, screenshot that visualizes the error, etc.)

# Creating an issue

- What is your need?
- Why do you want the issue to be implemented? (yea, I know because you need it but why? Give me some motivation ;))

# Creating a merge request

- Follow golang best-practices. [I found this enlightening.](https://go.dev/talks/2013/bestpractices.slide)
- You agree with the code of conduct and the licence of this repository
- Give me some time to review your request
